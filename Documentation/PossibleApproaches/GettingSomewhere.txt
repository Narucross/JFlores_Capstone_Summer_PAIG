	This way I can pratically devote a whole project to just data-mining,
	Lets make this a combination of Nini and Daisy

Gather templates for sentence structure
	Find things on the internet using data mining, and aquire those templates
	Have an external resource that makes it easy to find valid words or 
		congigations

I just need to know what I am gonna accomplish by next week
		What to expect at the next checkpoint
	
A personality is defined by the unique approach to situations and knowledge
	in the robots case this can be simulated by peculiararities in grammer.
	Traits:
		Approach to problem
		Peculiarities in grammer
		Levels of empathy or something else...
	
Those are the two things I need to simulate or enable:
	Peculiar approach to problems
	Peculiar entries in grammer
	
What are things I need done in two weeks with these goals in mind?
