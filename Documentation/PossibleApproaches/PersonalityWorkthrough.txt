Personalities are quintessentially:
An Algorithm with specific data

The original personality used an algorithm to store and supply key moments in the active frames of the
application. Using this algorithm would make the personality responcive and commited to the context of the situation.

Now a personality is simply the manipulation of the data, in this case key and similar words

A frequency Personality ticks everytime a word is present. I would want to disqualify say adjectives
	because they are intrisically meaningless

<Word,value> 
on addWord(word)
find(word) !=null
	incrementWord(wordLocation);
else
	addWord(word,1);
	
	
List of buckets
sorted by the first letter [all lowercase]
