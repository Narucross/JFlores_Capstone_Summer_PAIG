		The first part of Chatbot-type AI is how it reads and breaks up its input.
		These broken components can later be used as grammer ques for later responces.
			Input: String,
			Output1: Breaks up the string into patterns, multiple are printed
			Output2: Synonyms collected for each word in the string. 

			From an implementation standpoint, there should be two programs, 
			1 that takes the input String, and the another that sends the String to
			two different processes. One that breaks up the string into patterns that
			the AI will look out for.
			And the second one that will try to find English synonyms for the words
			of the string.

	Beginning of the user inteface described in the user stories.
	Particularly the ability to create multiple AI's, select an AI,
		Chatting with the AI, 
		At this point the AI should not give back intelligent responces, it will
		however take last weeks stuff, and document and store the patterns of 
		speech used. 
	As a responce it will probally print out for the user to read, the
				pattern that it deems most reasonable, or if the USer specified certain
				words that the AI should be gearing its behavior around, it will
				show which synonyms in the sentence match its words.
