	The first part of Chatbot-type AI is how it reads and breaks up its input.
	These broken components can later be used as grammer ques for later responces.
		Input: String,
		Output1: Breaks up the string into patterns, multiple are printed
		Output2: Synonyms collected for each word in the string. 

		From an implementation standpoint, there should be two programs, 
		1 that takes the input String, and the another that sends the String to
		two different processes. One that breaks up the string into patterns that
		the AI will look out for.
		And the second one that will try to find English synonyms for the words
		of the string.
