Create Package POC(proof of concepts)$
	-- Intended for grammar testing, or NLP open source library testing
Create Package  NLP Stache$
Create Package  Model?$
	-- Create the global AI interface, String_Responce (String Token_grammer)
	-- Each AI Brain has at least 3 components && is a sub-package in model:
		Interpreter(defined to a specific grammer), rational, responce
Create Package  AIHawker$
	^Hawker is a synonym for vendor, think of this as the frontal face of the application,
		The Hawker has a lists of personalities and can create them, and despenses them for
		Conversation when available.
	Interface for the contract between the hawker and the Personality: HawkToBrainComp
	
Console with no character limit$

Note: Make sure you train OpenNLP Models in order for them to be able to process several languages.(Speculative however it doesn't strictly state it can train to any language.)

// =============================================================================================================================================================================

AI now has to find things that it likes. Will you as a person who likes what I like, like a website? yes or no?
or generally how much will you like it?
		
	Idea...	
		Make the AI request synonyms or adjacent words in the format of pairs and a weight.
			Interface:
				ArrayList<stuff> getSynons(String refWords);
				
			--What this allows is IFFF I want to not include  a thesaurous I can, primarily
			
			thesaurus or wikipedia?
			
			Will involking the same experience reveal the same kind of personality?
				No.
		
		
		
		
	Idea...
		Thesaurus expansions could perhaps increase with inclusion of YahooAnswers API... Just a suggestion		
	
Thesaurus resource in use:
	Big Thesaurus by Big Huge Labs
	http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php
	
Web interaction: 
	How to pull pages from websites, and need a sync with either google or bing search engines.
	
	
	Thesaurus & Google search:
	Get webpage...Read it, : relational mapping or something
	
		
		
		
		
	Got to work on professional communication.
	
Deliverables:
	Start delivering solid work: -- earn a green
	Know where you are going for the next week: how does it fit for the whole project

-- How would it give a status report?
	
		
Come With one question answered as a starting point?
	--  Explain to me... what you are going to do with the results of that google search?
		Dewa?
		Now what?
		Flow: we get the word from the user, which is looked at by the thesaurus.
		in this application this tells the AI to develop its personality by implementation of the key words specified
		thus it will do it's own research on what characteristics are associated with that word.
			for instance with the example of baseball, courage is a good characteristic, so cowardise would be a bad one.
		In order to do its own research the first thing it needs is an access to a resivour of data,
			This is where the google search comes in
		After finding sources of information it needs to cherry pick from the resources, the characteristics it needs
			Thus it would have to be able, in lay mans terms, read a website, and find accociations with the words it has??
				I could also probally achieve this by continous calls to the dictionary.
				>> The google custom search we may need to involk better queries to not waste our search limits.
		
		What does it need to do?(after the google search)
			Read a website(s), find those accociations that are important to establishing the identity driven by the keywords.
	
		-- Sounds like it does have to be NLP?
		
		Read the website >> what if it is not safe? >>  step 2 would be to mapp important words
			Describe for me? What a personality how do you represent a personality? 
				In the bac? User's pers[ective? 
				

				
Where are we going to go from here?

	"Kind alike amazon works... This person bought this item, and These in conjunciton. Can your program due about the same but without tracking behavior,
	and instead by knowing pre-remptively what the person knows."
	
	Means of getting: the weighted components to our KEY WORDS, are the frequency they appear in: 
		The Thesaurus, Dictionary, and finally websites "selected" by people.
	Can our AI tell us if given KEY_WORDS can they give a level of confidence(relevance) to the website?
	
	Progression would get this "weighted tree" up and running.
	In the end we see say a personality with: Baseball++ and Basketball--
	How would it enjoy that behavior?
	
	Where do I go from here:
		Completed:
			Thesaurus, Google search,
		ToDO:
			website reader, Weighted instrument, Keyword inputs,  vote of confidence.
			Multiple parts
			// Techniqual merit
		WEBPagesz
		
		
Things to do(August 1st-August 7th)$:
	Test spellcheck to see if it returns good suggestions in string[] format$
	Google custom search implement finish (try to find a way to be more selective of blogs/heavy digested forums)$
	Start reading pages off the custom search, $
	weight instrument$, and status reports

Before consuming the frequency data, josh will have a plan that makes sense of the frequencies
	Status reports : 
	How dislikes will affect the likes results thing a ma gig
	Check phone logs

Week Plan:	
	That is basically all I can think of for today, 
	my mind wanders towards creating some sort of algorithm that the personalities
	follow in order to determine if a said website is likeable. 
	{
		That said I think this is where certain personalities can differ
		Like some act Benign towards websites, choosing to like a website
			but not adjusting its weights 
	}
	Advancing Frequency Counter{
		Get rid of "Useless" words like "the", "and", "then" 
			
		Consideration: different conjucations of the same word{"flowers" and "flower" are just counted as "flower"}
		
		Remove punctuations marks {'Apparently.','Apparently'}$
	}
	Personality{
		Add how the weights will be effected by "negative" keywords or dislikes
	}

What I can try is to get the chat stuff working cause I now know enough implementation paradyms that I could get it working...
//// ===================================================================================================================
Project succes:
	- No, The direction has changed from a talk client to a website confirmer or guide
	- No
User Stories
	11 total stories: 1 : 11
// Week 7
//// ===================================================================================================================
Characteristics to look for, for next week:
Amazon duplicate client:
	Create a status report based off the word count of the website, 
		In a sense will a person who has defined the current keywords like a certain website should or should it not be
			relevant to the cause.
			// Algothorithm that determines if a mapped personality would prefer a website, in sense we can start with word count.
				And then continue to do other stuff, we can explore with as much techniqual merit as possible here
	
True Chat personality
	Although discouraged(KTIN) he is also fine with either a working chat interface, 
		What he is expecting is along the lines that the personality is colored with ideas taken from webpages,
		So in a sense template matching is not an issue, we can relegate to certain senteces.
		Chatbot{
			Basic speech, and recognition.
			basicSpeech{
				
			}
			Recognition{
				forcusing on what is signifigant, some words detail action on our part like in questions.
					where some words are simply factual, which have no answer.
			}
		}
		
May have to try something new instead of Lemmanizations/stemmers, because they greatly fault results
	if it is not for statistical purposes
	One option {
		Is to Take every word and format it to a sentence of type structure
		this way when we look at a word the program can get a sense for when that word is used in
		without knowing anything about it. So this turns from NLP to memory mapping
		We will need some way to search for "behaviors" in order get fastish word choices.
	}
	
Build a Negative retrieval frequency syncro:
-- Show the correlation between a mapped webpage and frequency
// Show 2 pages one that the personsalitry shouldn't like..
Take that mapper and apply it to the personality
