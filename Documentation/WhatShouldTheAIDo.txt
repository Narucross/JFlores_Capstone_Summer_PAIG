The artificial intelligence should:
	Take string inputs.
	Adopt some of the grammatical mannerisms from the user.
	Its not machine learning. So I don't intend it to know what 1+1 is.
	But I do expect it to use different synonyms of words that have been used
		in previous conversations.
	The Ai is a chatbox except unlike cleverbot it does not have already
		Programmed behavior patterns, A goal in the project is that 
		Behavior of the AI progresses or has notible or sutble difference
		the more it interacts with the user. 
	The section where I wanted it to be able to traverse websites, is so that
		the user can present to the AI a large number of text within a short
		period, rather then manually copy + pasting.
