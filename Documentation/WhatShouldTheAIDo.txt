The artificial intelligence should:
	Take string inputs.
		
	Its not machine learning. So I don't intend it to know what 1+1 is.
	
	But I do expect it to use different synonyms of words that have been used
		in previous conversations.
		
	The Ai is a chatbox except unlike cleverbot it does not have already
		Programmed behavior patterns, A goal in the project is that 
		Behavior of the AI progresses or has notible or sutble difference
		the more it interacts with the user. 
		
	The AI will try to steer its behavior around certain words that the User wants 
		the Ai to adopt. For instance it will favor sentence structures that
		include the key words (and their synoymns) in its documentation.
	If the key words are unspecified it can choose its own keywords, and/or just
		adopt the grammer mannerisms of the users it is interacting with.
		
	The section where I wanted it to be able to traverse websites, is so that
		the user can present to the AI a large number of text within a short
		period of time , rather then manually copy + pasting.
