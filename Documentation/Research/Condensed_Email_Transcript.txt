Ryan:
1) Learn graphs they are you friend

2) Teach the creature about nouns and verbs, and that nouns can be either subjects or objects.

3) Then, given some source of text, categorize subjects, verbs, and objects

4) Take those nodes and establish relationships. That's where the graph comes in.

5) Trees are like graphs, but more constrained.

6) Then, given a sentence, the creature can permutate possible responses of the graph

Brandon:
Thats is a Start but you need rules for the grammers so how to build sentences and the 
	sfirst part is all the same the defining that will be the first step

And for most ways you need a good table of well defined words and relations but allowing the machine to build that would be the smarter way

You need to look up node trees which will help with the relations and stff

First understand what's going and auto knowledge building then you can start figuring the way of responding
