Hey can I ask for help? Not code, because it is all theoretical
and the internet does not describe, how to think about AI, implementation paradigms,
that is the kind of thing I am interested in and the internet is not delivering.

See I have been trying to create an Artificial intelligence, that the user can chat with.
The only niche is that the AI is suppose to get smarter over time.
Smarter in that it remembers more vocabulary over time. 
But this is literally the only line of code I could find that remotely describes
what this would look like: objectOf("ball","blue")
which basically says we have encountered a ball that is blue.
Do you have any ideas we could talk about? 
Thanks for your time,
from

Hey long time no see,
I sent this because frankly I need help.
See I have been trying to implement an Artificial intelligence basically a chat
bot that is suppose to get smarter over time. But the internet has not been my 
friend. It has been more content with just repeating the definition of an AI,
without mentioning design paradigms or what to think about if someone wanted
to implement an AI. 
Which I guess is the point cause they have job security that way, but it makes
it really frustrating to re-read the same thing over and over again.
Is there any way you can help me with this? I am truly at a lost on where to 
begin or what to design.
So far I have tried libraries like Apache Open NLP, and stanford NLP, 
because I thought: "Well probably the first place to start would be to read sentences,
and gather a way to organise that data." 

But I have just about given up trying to find a use for their API's.

Thanks for your time.
