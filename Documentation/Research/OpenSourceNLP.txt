6 steps for typical LSP-MLP processing chain:
	1.) Syntactic prasing stage. 
		a.) structures the sentences of a medical document.
			Represents the dependencies by means of parse trees.
			Can handle conjunctions.
	2.) Semantic selection
			Use occurrence patterns to imporve parsing trees by resolving cases of
				Structural ambiguioty.
				Semantic characterisaztion of parts of the parse tree is done on this level.
	3.) Transformation stage. 	
		Fills in gaps due to conjunction ellipses, reduces all sentence thypes to the
			affirmative type, completes relative sentences and regroups verbal splits.
	4.) Regularization stage.	
		Transforms semantically augmented parse tree into a canonical tree
			Consistenting of elementrary sentences that correspond to the basic 
				sublanguage sentence types. 
		The infected forms are replaced by their canonical form and the semantic host 
			modifiers are identified.
	5.) Information formatting stage
		The formatting modules maps the words of the elementary sentences into the 
			appropriate fields of a format tree and constructs a binary connective-
			format tree for each sentence with the connectives as parent, and the
			phrases on which it operates as left and right children.
	6.) The normalization stage.
		Recovers implicit knowledge when possible and maps the format trees into 
			the relational database structures.
